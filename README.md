# fill-in-the-blanks
My game consists of 3 levels depending on the complexity of the text. Each level is represented by a text segment with 4 blanks to fill. I structured the code so it can be easily modified for more blanks or levels. Each text segment is stored in the "segment" variable with a number indicating the complexity level and those variables are stored in the "segment_full" list.
